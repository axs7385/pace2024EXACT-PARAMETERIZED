# one-sided crossing minimization problem Solver(The Heuristic Track)

This repository contains a both exact and parameterized Solver for the one-sided crossing minimization problem that were developed for the PACE 2024 challenge. 

The solver is developped with g++ v10.1.0 in the Linux system.

To use it, you only need the C++ standard library and a g++ compiler. 

To build, use:
```
g++ pace.cpp -o pace -O2
```

To run, use:
```
./pace
```

The problem is piped in via STDIN.

The solution is emitted via STDOUT.
